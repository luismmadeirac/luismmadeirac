### Luis Madeira

Just a developer passionate about building clean and efficient web applications.
I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with code, and sharing my projects with the community.

Fun Facts:

- 110% workaholic
- Working on a template for devs looking to build enterprise apps and achieve various certifications (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCIe, etc.)
- Currently addicted to MLB & golf; F1 is starting to lose its appeal
- I have a 90kg pony (Saint Bernard)
- I love whisky

Certifications:

* AWS, Azure, Cisco, etc. â€” way too much money burned on that wagon
